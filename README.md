![Project Discontinued](https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/MyData-Mono/assets/11202073/94e83ef8-b320-48c7-8a38-91ee4cc6098c)

This project has been discontinued. Since MyData in this form has been used for Star Story II, a few fixes could occur but only in the benefit of that project or for fixes of projects before that.
Any new projects will use [MyData II](https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/MyData-II) in stead. MyData II should support everything the old MyData supported, and more. If some features are not present there yet, they are planned for the longer term, and if you have anything missing there that you think I forgot, use the Issue Tracker there. 

This repository will remain open for the very necessary fixes I may need to do, but you can consider this repo as "deprecated".
As soon as Star Story II is officially finished, this repository may soon be closed an archived.

# MyData Mono

MyData is a very simplistic Database program set up to create and maintain large amounts of data some game genres will inevitably need. RPG games in particular.
With MyData this data can be maintained quickly, and it can export to various scripting languages and MarkUp languages, and expansion is possible, due to its class-based modular approach of the exporter.

Read the Wiki for more detailed information on how to use MyData
