# MyData Mono

At the present time, this repository will just be an experiment to see if I can master the Mono Framework. This framework interests me so much as I want to be more easily portable with my programs to Windows, Mac and Linux than I am now, and if the mono framework can provide me this flexibility I'll take it.
Now I am just trying to get MyData the simple DataBase program I coded in BlitzMax in the past in Visual Studio with the help of C# and the GTK# framework. The outcome of this experiment will show if I'll continue to use this framework in the future.

This repository has also been set up to test the built-in git manager in Visual Studio... I guess the initial push shows stuff works.

If this experiment works, then MyData will be a serious project, and then this readme file will also be adapted to it's "more professional" form, and then the original MyData may get deprecated and even discontinued.


My object is to leave the original file format of MyData the way it is, so the original MyData and MyData Mono will (for the time being) remain compatible.
